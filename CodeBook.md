#####Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project  
Summary Dataset in Tidy form derived from original features
in the original dataset of Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset version 1.0

For more details about the original experiment and dataset refer to the
UCI HAR Dataset
The smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory
www.smartlab.ws

Additional information about the sensors can be found in

**Each summary dataset record contains the following columns:**
- **activity:** A descriptive activity lablels generated by indexing the activity_labels table read from 'activity_labels.txt' file.


|ID|activity|
|-------|-------|
|1| WALKING|
|2| WALKING_UPSTAIRS|
|3| WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS|
|4| SITTING|
|5| STANDING|
|6| LAYING|

- **subject:** Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity.
          Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- **feature:** The original feature variable names where read from 'features.txt' and transformed eliminating the '()' and replacing all '-' with a more standard underscore '_' symbol.

- The features columns of interest where selected and combined: activity, subject, features of interest ('_std' or '_mean')  
          Features were selected from the original feature vector if they end with '-std()' or '-mean()'.
- We adhere to the original convention for variable name tagging it with 't' or 'f' for time or FFT respectively.  
          Additionally, since they are all averages or the original feature variable we prefix the variable name with Avg_


- Each row on the dataset text file shows the desciptive activity, the subject and the average of the feature vector.
- The dataset is grouped and sorted by 'activity' then by 'subject' so for each activity list all subjects and their averaged feature vector
